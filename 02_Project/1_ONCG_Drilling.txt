 Wellsite Information Transfer Standard Markup Language (WITSML) is a standard for sending well site information in an XML document format between business partners.

 All information from objects are not extracted and effectively used

 collaborative approach using text mining to mine-unfavourable events

 1. Information Reterieval
 2. Inforamtion Extraction
 3. Clustering
 4. Pattern Identification

on daily drilling report from well

text mining convert unstructured in-to structured

This approach build an effective risk inventoy that can 
be used for futue planning

We focused in 
  Reterieval
  Extraction
  Bag of Words & frequency distribution
  Clustering
  Pattern


1. Reterieval : Mentor gave used

2. Inforamtion Extraction : pre-processng data by applying technique
                            tokenization, stemming, eliminating stop-word

                            text is visualised based on words and their frequency 
                            using Bag of Words

3. Clustering and Pattern Identification : words are grouped toether based on words
                                         which appear together within the same context 
                                         by applying  k-means Clustering

bag of word
tokenization


Tokenization is a way of separating a piece of text into smaller units called tokens.
  Here, tokens can be either words,
word tokenizer  It splits a piece of text into individual words 

To put simply, stemming is the process of removing a part of a word,
 or reducing a word to its stem or root

 stopword in english like  , at, a, the.

Bag of Words model is used to preprocess the text by converting it into a bag of words,
 which keeps a count of the total occurrences of most frequently used words
